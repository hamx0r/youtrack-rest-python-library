This module was written by the Asana team as their Python client:
https://github.com/Asana/python-asana

I've copied v0.5.1 here to eliminate dependencies. If I should instead require the user to install `python-asana`, then
this directory can be removed from the repo, and simply leave asana2youtrack.py in place.
